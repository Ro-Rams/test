##### **Welcome to Confluence!**

You can use Confluence to create a rich knowledge base or to collaborate with others using words, videos, images, graphics, charts, and graphs.

This page walks you through some Confluence basics like spaces, pages, and elements that allow you to create and manage impactful content for your teams.

**Confluence 101**
==================

üóÉÔ∏è Spaces
----------

Spaces are places for individuals, teams, and companies to organize and work on ideas, projects, documentation, and announcements. Spaces can be customized and integrated with both Atlassian tools and others. [Create](https://confluence.atlassian.com/conf73/create-a-space-991927526.html) as many spaces as you need to get things done:

###### Give each team their own space so they can work closely and make information easier to find.

###### Put all the information related to your project in one place so everyone can work together.

###### Store anything you‚Äôre working on, keep your to-do lists, and polish content before moving it into a shared space.

**In the main navigation bar, select** `Spaces`**‚Üí** `Create space` **to create a new space.**

üìÑ Pages
--------

Pages are where teams define, collaborate on, and document their work. They‚Äôre the building blocks of Confluence.

To create a page within a space, select the `+` to create a new page. You can also create pages using the `Create` button in the main navigation bar.

**Press** `c` **to create a page at any time.**

**Making purposeful content**
=============================

‚úèÔ∏è Confluence editor

Changes can only be made to page content when in the editor. Changes will save automatically and be pushed live the next time the page is published.

üõ†Ô∏è Templates
-------------

If you‚Äôre not sure where to start when setting up a new space or page, save time with a space or page template.

**Press** `e` **when on a page to open the editor.**

üì∏ Header images
----------------

Make your pages more visually impactful with emojis and header images. üçï Emojis aren‚Äôt just a fun way to spice up your page‚Äîthey also show up in search, so using them strategically makes it easier to find pages later on.

**Select** `Add status` **at the top of the page, so teammates can see your progress at a glance.**

**Collaborating with teammates**
================================

üßë‚Äçüíª Real-time editing
-----------------------

You and up to 11 teammates can edit a page together in real time. Changes save and sync automatically so that everyone editing sees the same thing. Start editing together by selecting the **Edit** icon in the header.

**Press** `Command + Enter` **when in the editor to publish.**

[Learn more about collaborative editing](https://support.atlassian.com/confluence-cloud/docs/create-edit-and-publish-a-page/#Collaborative-editing)

üí¨ Mentions and comments
------------------------

Comments are a great way to start a conversation about a page or blog post. They allow you to remark on content, add important information, ask questions, and generally drive collaboration and teamwork.

@mention a teammate to bring them into the conversation, and they can reply to and/or like comments.

**Inline comment ‚Üí**Added to a highlighted section of the page or post you are editing or viewing; good for targeted comments on a specific word or phrase. **Page comment ‚Üí**Added below the content of the page or post you are viewing; good for comments that apply to the content as a whole. **Leave an inline comment when viewing a page or in the editor.**

**Organizing your content**
===========================

üå≥ Page tree
------------

The page tree is where your content is organized within a space. Drag and drop to reorder or nest pages, so you can more effectively share your work with others.

[Learn more about the page tree](https://support.atlassian.com/confluence-cloud/docs/move-copy-and-hide-pages/)

üì£ Space overview
-----------------

To help your teammates find relevant content, curate your space overview with useful elements like calendars and page statuses, and include information about what is in your space.

**Use the** `/info` **panel element to highlight important information in your space overview.**

üåª Content types
----------------

###### If your content that won‚Äôt change over time, create it as a blog post. The blog feed for each space displays the most recent posts first.

###### If your content may change over time, create it as a page. Pages nest, so you can create categories and subcategories.

**Press** `k` **for a shareable link to your page or post.**

üìè Tables
---------

Tables allow you to organize important information on a page to discuss it with your team. Present the information the way it makes sense to you‚Äîresize columns, color cells, rows and columns, and sort the table by clicking the column headers.

**Type** `/table` **to add a table at any time.**

[Learn more about tables](https://confluence.atlassian.com/conf73/tables-991927743.html)

üå± Drafts
---------

Confluence autosaves your content as you work‚Äîif you select `Close` in the editor without publishing, you‚Äôll create a draft, or an unpublished page you can get back to at any time.

**Only you can see your draft, unless you share a link to it.**
